/**
* This code snippet was written by John W. Ratcliff on April 14, 2022
* The purpose of this code snippet is to document the format of the
* bitcoin block headers which are written out to the leveldb database.
* 
* All code needed to parse one of these custom headers is located here,
* which includes the method to extract variable length integers.
* 
* *** IMPORTANT NOTE *** : The formatting of variable length integers by bitcoin core
* when it writes to the levelDB is *NOT* the same variable length format used by 
* the rest of the bitcoin blockchain. Moreover, the encoding is *NOT STANDARD*!
* It appears to be some custom routine rolled just for the bitcoin source code.
* So you mush take a look at the 'readVarint128' method closely to see how
* these integers are decoded.
* 
* This is to serve as a more complete answer to the question previously
* posted here: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/67515/format-of-a-block-keys-contents-in-bitcoinds-leveldb
* 
* The corresponding code in the bitcoin source code looks like this: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/chain.h
*   SERIALIZE_METHODS(CDiskBlockIndex, obj)

        int _nVersion = s.GetVersion();
