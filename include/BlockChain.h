// This is a minimal C++ code snippet to read the bitcoin block chain one by one into memory.
//
// This code snippet was written by John W. Ratcliff (jratcliffscarab@gmail.com) on June 30, 2013 on a lazy rainy Sunday afternoon 
// It has been recently revised on September 22, 2015.
//
// I wrote this code snippet for two reasons.  First, I just wanted to understand the bitcoin blockchain format myself and
// since I run the full bitcoin-qt client on my machine, I have all the data stored on my hard drive anyway.
//
// I did find this excellent reference online; from which this code was written.  Think of this code snippet as essentially just a reference implementation
// of what is already covered on Jame's blog.
//
// If you find this code snippet useful; you can tip me at this bitcoin address:

//http://james.lab6.com/2012/01/12/bitcoin-285-bytes-that-changed-the-world/
//
// https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_specification
//
// One problem with Jame's specification is it's not always super clear what the heirachy of the input data is; the classes in this header file
// should hopefully make that a bit more clear.
//
// An important note, a number of the inputs in the blockchain are marked as 'variable length integers' (presumably to 'save space' even though they really don't)
// The variable length integer is capable of being as large as 64 bits but, in actuality, never is.
// That's why all of the integers in the following data structures are 32 bits in size.
//
// A couple of items; sometimes you can run out of blockchain data before you reach the end of the file.  Past a certain point the file just contains zeroes.
// This was not documented in Jame's page; but it is what I encounterd in the input data set.
//
// There are also many cases where the actual data in the block is a lot less than the reported block-length.  I'm going to assume that this too is normal
// and expected.
